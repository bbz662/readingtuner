# Privacy Policy for Reading Tuner

Effective Date: 2024 April 21

This Privacy Policy describes how Reading Tuner ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and discloses information through its Chrome extension.

## Information We Collect

Website Content: We temporarily process text content from web pages that users have explicitly chosen to simplify through the Reading Tuner extension. This text is sent to OpenAI's API to generate a simplified version suitable for children based on the selected age range.

User Preferences: We store users' preferences, such as target age and OpenAI API key, locally on users' devices using Chrome's storage API.

## How We Use Information

The website content is used solely for the purpose of simplifying the text and is not stored after the processing is complete.
User preferences are stored to maintain a personalized experience and to authenticate requests sent to the OpenAI API for text simplification.

## How We Share Information

OpenAI API: Text content is shared with OpenAI API for the sole purpose of simplifying the text, using the API key you provide.
We do not sell or share any user data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.

## Data Security

We take the protection of your data seriously and implement reasonable security measures to protect it. However, no security system is impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of these systems.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on our GitHub repository.
